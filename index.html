This paper presents a novel adaptive active learning strategy.The most accurate classification model from a heterogeneous
classifier pool is selected at each learning epoch. Our goal is to achieve greater incremental improvement in accuracy,compared
to using a single type of classification model throughout the process.The strategy is evaluated on benchmark data sets.
We further consider an application to texture classification problems in sonar mosaic imagery and compare it with non-adaptive
active learning and traditional machine learning approaches.Our results show that....We conclude that....

     <p class="ex1">
       <pre>
Active Learning (Angluin, 1988, Cohn et al., 1994) is a paradigm where a concept is learnt by an
intelligent machine through the interaction of an oracle with the machine system, over a sequence of
learning epochs. A distinctive component in an active system is the querying strategy, used to sample
candidate training instances from a pool and evaluate them for informativeness, i.e., their potential
to improve the classification model. Various strategies have been proposed including; Query by
Committee (Seung et al., 1992), Monte Carlo estimation (Roy and McCallum, 2001), uncertainty
sampling (Lewis and Gale, 1994) and version space reduction (margin sampling) (Tong and Koller,
2001). Irrespective of how the most informative pattern instances are chosen at each epoch they are
presented for labeling, to a machine (database) or human oracle that has knowledge of the class
labels. After adding the newly labeled instances to the current training set, a revised model is
subsequently induced. A goal of this process is to achieve an efficient, incremental advancement of
learning at each epoch. The process is continued until some stopping criterion has been met, such as
reaching a stage where information from the selected instances is contrary to the model, causing the
classifier confidence to drop, as in Vlachos (2008).”

<h3 id="The Evolution of Autonomous Flights">The Evolution of Autonomous Flights</h3>

<p>
  <pre>
With the technological advancements made in AI, the miniaturisation of key components and sensory technology: unmanned aircraft 
otherwise known as ‘Drones` have seen a drastic rise exceeding 850,000 by early 2023. With these breakthroughs drones can perceive, 
make informed decisions and adapt to their surroundings instantaneously, completely revolutionising the agricultural and surveillance sectors. 
The UK Government and industry have made a co-investment near £300 million dollars to programmes such as “Future Flight Challenge”, 
aiming for further development of future flight services, enabling technologies (Autonomy/AI), digital communications and electric 
propulsion to be integrated. Aviation 2050 was also proposed for the future of aviation through automation, electrification and 
digitalisation. Aviation contributes over £22 Billion to the economy so it can be seen why the government is so heavily invested into 
this industry. These collaborative endeavours focus on establishing structures to understand autonomous technologies, allocating 
funding for research on independent systems and the nurturing of alliances between both public and private sectors to further 
adopt autonomous technologies in our basic day to day lives.

<h3 id="Challenges in Autonomous Aviation">Challenges in Autonomous Aviation</h3>

<p>
  <pre>
Elaine Herzberg would be the first pedestrian to fall victim to autonomy in 2018 where one of Uber’s autonomous test vehicles would 
collide with her causing fatal injuries. “The real danger is not falling behind competitors in AI, but the perception of a race will 
prompt everyone to rush to deploy unsafe AI systems”- Paul Scharre, perfectly summarises the incident. With companies such as “Tesla” 
making spectacular breakthroughs leading to sales of AI systems with impressive capabilities but weak safety assurance. Manufacturers/Integrators 
and regulators work together to ensure priority in the highest safety standards to instil public confidence paving a way for the
widespread adoption of autonomation. However, as new technologies continue to emerge they will interact with a system of systems so
it is crucial that these systems work collaboratively so in the rare case of failure it won’t compromise the system as a whole. Safety 
critical system developers will need to balance the cost/time constraints needed for these systems while simultaneously identifying 
limitations. The challenge to keep developing safety critical systems will only become more tedious as machines become more complex 
hence in this global race to develop autonomous technologies, the development and integration of safety critical systems must remain at the forefront.

 <h3 id="Commercial Applications in Autonomous Aviation">Commercial Applications in Autonomous Aviation</h3>

<p>
  <pre>
Autonomous drones will completely revolutionize delivery services and displays almost limitless potential. Pioneering companies like 
Amazon are promising deliveries in under one hour with the utilization of this technology and will be introduced to the UK by the end
of 2024 and has been stated to be “hundreds of times safer” than going to a shop and buying it. Amazon’s plans will help “boost the economy” 
and offer more choices to consumers while keeping the “environment clean with zero emission technology” as stated by Baroness Vere and 
added that the government aims to make commercial drones by 2030. Autonomous continue to revolutionize diverse industries with their 
versatility in surveillance, data collection and monitoring. From deliveries to security, these unmanned air vehicles can provide impeccable 
efficiency and precision. In archaeology drones have married AI equipped with light detection and ranging to scan below the ground revealing 
artefacts and sites which would otherwise be invisible to the naked eye. Additionally, autonomous drones play a pivotal role in law enforcement 
agencies being able to monitor large areas efficiently and send live feeds to personnel ensuring immediate action against threats. Their 
adaptability throughout industries demonstrates their adaptability and contribution to a vast array of sectors, making them priceless of 
streamlined operations.

 <h3 id="AI integration in Autonomous Systems">AI integration in Autonomous Systems</h3>

<p>
  <pre>
Machine learning plays a key role in the amplification of navigation systems in autonomous aircrafts/drones. It equips drones with the 
ability to navigate autonomously by processing sensor data in real time. With capabilities like “terrain recognition” and “obstacle 
avoidance”, elevating their decision-making prowess; their ability to classify terrain to ensure safe flight paths ensuring meticulous 
navigation. The integration of machine learning in autonomous offers a broad range of applications in: traffic management, weather 
forecasting, predictive maintenance and many more.  We can cultivate a safer and more effective operation even during unpredictability. 
In the realm of military aviation, AI has already been used extensively as a tool to help pilots during combat mission decision-making. 
This already serves as an excellent foundation for the crossover into commercial airlines. It has the potential to monitor the aircraft
maintenance condition, weather conditions, operational threats and contingency procedures in air traffic regulations, significantly 
reducing the crew workload.

 <h3 id="Environmental Impact and Sustainability">Environmental Impact and Sustainability</h3>

<p>
  <pre>
The integration of electric propulsion, presents itself as a cleaner alternative, replacing tradition engines with streamlined electrical 
motors. Offering heightened energy efficiency, lower noise levels and reducing overall fuel consumption. Major companies such as “Boeing” 
and “Airbus” are investing into electric propulsion technologies to develop a fully electric aircraft the reason for this is very self-explanatory 
as to why companies many do this with reasons such as, improving public perception, receiving government funding, lower operating costs and 
more importantly the significant reduction of carbon emissions. The integration of electric propulsion will truly serve as a pivotal stride 
towards an environmentally friendly future. 
   
   
  </pre>
</p>


  <h3 id="Security Concerns">Security Concerns</h3>

<p>
  <pre>
In recent years threats of malicious actors exploiting vulnerabilities especially in aircraft systems have become increasingly urgent. 
An example of this would be the large scale data breaches suffered by British Airways in 2018, it exposed vulnerabilities within airlines 
and the potential impact on passenger data security. This would be followed up again in March 2021 where SITA which is responsible for 
handling bookings for approximately 90% of the world would fall victim to a hack. It isn’t long until the domain of autonomous aviation 
systems fall victim to these data breaches, the only difference being consequences could be substantially worse. Hence cyber security protocols
must be adopted in order to shield sensitive information to cultivate trust between passengers and stake holders but ultimately to ensure 
the security and safety of passengers.
   
   
  </pre>
</p>

  <h3 id="Future Outlooks">Future Outlooks</h3>

<p>
  <pre>
The evolution of autonomous aviation signifies a future brimming with possibilities and ideas propelled by continuous research that continues
to push limits and break boundaries. As more groundbreaking feats are accomplished through government funded schemes and start ups such as
“UKRI”, “Aviation 2050”, the skies hold promise for more sustainable and readily available air travel pushing us into a future gleaming with potential.
